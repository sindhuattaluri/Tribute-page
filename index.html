        <p>Women of today are the most powerful they create their own destinies and fulfill their dreams. one such remarkable woman is Vineeta Singh the co-founder at homegrown brand SUGAR Cosmetics. Vineeta has been inspiring women entreprenuers from the last 2-3 years and has proved that risks that are taken with sheer determination.Vineeta completed her electrical engineering from IIT Madras and then moved on to pursue her Business Studies at IIM Ahemdabad. By the end of her course Vineeta had firmly planned on building her own startup and hence she rejected a 1 Crore job offer in order to do that.</p>
            <p>In an article by Entreprenuer.com she said, “I always felt strongly about building something with women as the core customer, so when my first startup didn’t scale, I decided to launch a beauty subscription company with my co-founder, Kaushik, in 2012. The 200,000 women who shared their detailed beauty preferences with us were at the heart of our pivot to SUGAR Cosmetics, which launched as a direct-to-consumer makeup brand in 2015.”Women in India always struggled to get the right shade of cosmetics for their skin and hence they always relied on outsourcing makeup products from foreign brands. And that’s where SUGAR Cosmetics came into the picture. Vineeta aimed at creating makeup products solely for Indian skin tones which will be made in India for India.

                Sugar Cosmetics was very well marketed as it was able to create a buzz on social media including Instagram, Facebook, and Youtube, targeting the female audience aged between 20-35 years.</p>
